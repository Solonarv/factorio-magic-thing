focuses on manipulating and moving mana around

mana is never created or destroyed, only changed in form

mana comes in a few forms:
- celestine, associated with the sky
- chthonic, associated with the earth and underground
- motive, associated with life, death, and motion
- still

each chunk has a store of atmospheric mana of each type, which is initially 0.

machines and their processes might transform one kind of atmospheric mana into another,
or use up atmospheric mana to create items, or release mana from items into the atmosphere.

some types of atmospheric mana spread between chunks.
- still and chthonic mana don't move
- celestine moves to wherever there is more chthonic mana
- motive moves towards more living/moving things (biters, trees, the player, machines)
- celestine and chthonic in the same chunk transmute into still and motive (in equal proportion) and vice versa

important machines:
mana condenser: takes atmospheric mana and spits out crystals (mana in item form)
mana evaporator: the reverse
mana reactor: performs the conversion reactions (set a recipe) on mana crystals
